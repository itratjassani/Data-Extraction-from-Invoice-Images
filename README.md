# Data Extraction From Invoice Images

## Problem Statement

Many businesses deal with handwritten invoices, which can be time-consuming to process manually. To streamline this process, a program has been developed to extract text and relevant data, such as phone numbers and emails, from handwritten invoice images. The primary goal is to automate the extraction process, improving efficiency and reducing errors associated with manual data entry.

## Challenges:

1. Handwriting Variability:
Handwritten text can vary significantly, making accurate OCR and data extraction challenging.

2. Noise and Distortions:
Images may contain noise, distortions, or poor quality, affecting the accuracy of text extraction.

3. Data Validation:
Ensuring the accuracy of the extracted phone numbers poses a challenge, especially with variations in formats.

4. Integration with Existing Systems:
Integrating the program with existing invoicing or data management systems may require additional customization.

## Results



## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the developed program addresses the need for automating the extraction of text and relevant data from handwritten invoices, with a focus on phone numbers. Despite facing challenges related to handwriting variability, image quality, and data validation, the program provides a valuable solution for businesses looking to streamline their invoicing processes. Overall, the program contributes to increased efficiency and reduced manual effort in handling handwritten invoices.
